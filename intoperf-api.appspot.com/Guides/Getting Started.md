### Before you begin

Make sure you have your unique **IntoPerf API key**. If you don't or you get authentication errors when using it please contact admin@intoperf.com

### Using the API

* Don't use HTTP, use HTTPS instead.
* Each request to IntoPerf API should have a key parameter in it. For example: ```https://api.intoperf.com/players?key=YOUR_API_KEY```

Browse the reference section of this site to see examples of what you can do with this API and how to use it. You can use the **Try this API** tool on the right side of an API method page to generate a sample request.
